  <title>1 Introduction</title>
  <p>As part of the Arizona Tri-University Recharge (ATUR) project,
  multiple methods for identifying and quantifying ephemeral water
  bodies across the state of Arizona (AZ) are investigated. For reasons
  that will be discussed, accurate identification of ephemeral, or
  temporary, water bodies is a challenge, and efforts to-date have shown
  limited success. Methods, results, and challenges are discussed, and
  potential paths forward are explored.</p>
  <p>Ephemeral water bodies are common features in the arid American
  southwest. Typically very shallow, these water bodies range in size
  from a few cm rock pools to flash flood associated sheet flow, and
  playas up to several km in diameter
  (<xref alt="Crawford, 1981" rid="ref-Clifford_Crawford" ref-type="bibr">Crawford,
  1981</xref>;
  <xref alt="Whitford &amp; Duval, 2020" rid="ref-Whitford_Duval_2020" ref-type="bibr">Whitford
  &amp; Duval, 2020</xref>). While playas and intermittent streams are
  well mapped across AZ, there is no consensus on the volume of water
  which flows through these systems. More to the point, there is no
  widely accepted estimate of the volume of water which either
  evaporates or recharges from these internally draining basins.</p>
  <p>It is not clear what fraction of water which flows onto a playa is
  evaporated vs. recharged. On the one hand, the nature of playas
  results in the slow accumulation of surface salts and fine sediments
  (clays and silts), which are generally impervious and detrimental to
  infiltration and subsequent recharge
  (<xref alt="Whitford &amp; Duval, 2020" rid="ref-Whitford_Duval_2020" ref-type="bibr">Whitford
  &amp; Duval, 2020</xref>). Additionally, playas may be an oasis for
  drought resistant flora, increasing local evapotranspiration, even
  after shallow surface soil layers have dried out
  (<xref alt="Crawford, 1981" rid="ref-Clifford_Crawford" ref-type="bibr">Crawford,
  1981</xref>). Alternately, these mineral rich surface crusts may be
  prone to expansion when wetted, and are frequently characterized by
  deep cracks which provide avenues for water infiltration below the
  impervious layers
  (<xref alt="Whitford &amp; Duval, 2020" rid="ref-Whitford_Duval_2020" ref-type="bibr">Whitford
  &amp; Duval, 2020</xref>). While the majority of water flowing onto
  most playas will be lost to evaporation, there may be specific playas
  where water loss by infiltration may exceed evaporation
  (<xref alt="Whitford &amp; Duval, 2020" rid="ref-Whitford_Duval_2020" ref-type="bibr">Whitford
  &amp; Duval, 2020</xref>). At least initially, we will assume that all
  water flowing onto playas shall be evaporated, subject to later
  reevaluation and refinement.</p>
  <p>The primary target of this study is to estimate and quantify the
  volume of water flowing into small to medium sized playas, on the
  order of ~50 m to ~1 km in diameter, although identification of sheet
  flow may also be incidental. The general method outlined is to use
  remote sensing technology to identify standing water broadly across
  the study area, across a time series. By identifying standing water,
  and assuming a constant water depth, water volume can be estimated.
  Additionally, an approximation of “continuously wetted” days can
  provide an initial estimate of evaporation rates, and through
  comparison with alternate evapotranspiration estimates, may be useful
  for estimating infiltration rate (e.g. if water loss rate is 2
  cm^3/day and the evapotranspiration rate is 1.5 cm^3/day then the
  implied infiltration rate would be 0.5 cm^3/day).</p>
  <p>The study area used for method development is primarily Hualapai
  Playa (a.k.a. Red Lake), located in northwest AZ, approx. 60 km
  south-southwest of Lake Mead
  (<xref alt="Figure 1" rid="fig-PlayaRef">Figure 1</xref>). This
  ephemeral playa is roughly 1 km in diameter, and is one of the largest
  playas in AZ. Furthermore, local landowners surrounding Hualapai Playa
  have expressed sincere interest in our project, creating additional
  public-relations incentives related to this particular playa. Lastly,
  it’s proximity to Lake Mead and Lake Mohave provide a convenient
  region for testing these methods against known areas of permanent
  surface water.</p>

  </fig>
  <p>One of the most challenging aspects of developing these methods is
  the lack of quality ground-truth data. Without existing data regarding
  date and duration of standing water within these ephemeral features,
  it is extremely difficult to validate our methods. While reasonable
  assumptions can be made about method accuracy (or inaccuracy as the
  case may be), any method, either those presented herein, or future
  methods not yet considered, will have to be validated using a known
  and well characterized ephemeral water body, ideally within AZ, or
  elsewhere in a similar arid environment.</p>
